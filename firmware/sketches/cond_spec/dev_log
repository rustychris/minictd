Wire.begin() hangs when called from the MS5803 constructor.  Probably it happens out of
order and depends on something that's not enabled yet.  Better to call it from SeaDuck::setup().

Real time clock:

Arduino time library supports down to seconds, and can be layered on top of teensy 3 clock.
Will return time as unix standard seconds.

Should I read from the arduino API, directly from Teensy3Clock, or from whatever
lies beneath the surface of that? Not sure what the benefit would be of the 
Arduino API at this point.  Already have to reach under the covers to get sub-second
resolution.

SD Card next??
 - on freebird, did the SD code use the teensy-specific I2C library?  I don't think so.
   that was just for interleaving calls to the ADS1115 and MPU9150.
 - were there local modifications to any other parts of that code?
 - will try the 3rd party SdFat, which is what freebird used, and is supposed to be
   more up to date than the SD library.
